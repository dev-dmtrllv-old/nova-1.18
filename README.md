# Nova Mod

## To Add:
- White Oak Biomes:
	- white oak forest
	- white oak plains
	- white oak sunflower plains

- Blood Moon (event):
	- Once every 31 days(?) a blood moon will rise. This is an event which enables some game mechanics of the mod. While the blood moon is up there will be an increase in the mob spawn rate, all the light levels in the game will decrease (which enables more places for hostile mobs to spawn). Some more ideas can also benefit form this event (like the moon stone).

- Moon Stone (block/item):
	- Obtainability: The moon stone is an ore that can be found only super high in the mountains. The block can not be silk-touched (enchantment). The stone can only be mined by a tier higher or equal as iron. When it's a not a Blood Moon night the block will drop an ordinary Moon Stone Ore, else when it's night and the Blood Moon event is active then the block will drop a special Moon Stone Ore.
